You are viewing the documentation for AWS IoT Greengrass Version 1, which has moved into [maintenance mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v1/developerguide/maintenance-policy.html)\. If you're new to AWS IoT Greengrass, we strongly recommend that you use AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2, which receives new features, includes all key V1 features, and supports additional platforms and continuous deployments to large fleets of devices\. For more information, see [What's new in AWS IoT Greengrass V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-v2-whats-new.html) and [Move from AWS IoT Greengrass V1 to V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/move-from-v1.html)\.
