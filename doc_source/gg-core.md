# Configure the AWS IoT Greengrass Core<a name="gg-core"></a>

An AWS IoT Greengrass core is an AWS IoT thing \(device\)\. Like other AWS IoT devices, a core exists in the registry, has a device shadow, and uses a device certificate to authenticate with AWS IoT\. The core device runs the AWS IoT Greengrass core software, which enables it to manage local processes for Greengrass groups, such as communication, shadow sync, and token exchange\.

The AWS IoT Greengrass Core software provides the following functionality:
+ Deployment and local execution of connectors and Lambda functions\.
+ Secure, encrypted storage of local secrets and controlled access by connectors and Lambda functions\.
+ MQTT messaging over the local network between devices, connectors, and Lambda functions using managed subscriptions\.
+ MQTT messaging between AWS IoT and devices, connectors, and Lambda functions using managed subscriptions\.
+ Secure connections between devices and the cloud using device authentication and authorization\.
+ Local shadow synchronization of devices\. Shadows can be configured to sync with the cloud\.
+ Controlled access to local device and volume resources\.
+ Deployment of cloud\-trained machine learning models for running local inference\.
+ Automatic IP address detection that enables devices to discover the Greengrass core device\.
+ Central deployment of new or updated group configuration\. After the configuration data is downloaded, the core device is restarted automatically\.
+ Secure, over\-the\-air software updates of user\-defined Lambda functions\.

## AWS IoT Greengrass Core Configuration File<a name="config-json"></a>

The configuration file for the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software is `config.json`\. It is located in the `/greengrass-root/config` directory\.

**Note**  
*greengrass\-root* represents the path where the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software is installed on your device\. If you installed the software by following the steps in the [Getting Started](gg-gs.md) tutorial, then this is the `/greengrass` directory\.  
If you use the **Easy group creation** option from the AWS IoT Greengrass console, then the `config.json` file is deployed to the core device in a working state\.

 You can review the contents of this file by running the following command:

```
cat /greengrass-root/config/config.json
```

The following is an example `config.json` file\. This is the version that's generated when you create the core from the AWS IoT Greengrass console\.

The `crypto` object, added in v1\.7\.0, introduces properties that support private key storage on a hardware security module \(HSM\) through PKCS\#11 and local secret storage\. For more information, see [Hardware Security Integration](hardware-security.md) and [Deploy Secrets to the AWS IoT Greengrass Core](secrets.md)\. Configurations for private key storage on HSMs or in the file system are supported\.

## Endpoints Must Match the Certificate Type<a name="certificate-endpoints"></a>

Your AWS IoT and AWS IoT Greengrass endpoints must correspond to the certificate type of the root CA certificate on your device\.

If you're using an Amazon Trust Services \(ATS\) root CA certificate \(preferred\), you must use ATS endpoints\. ATS endpoints include the `ats` segment, as shown in the following syntax for the AWS IoT endpoint\.

```
prefix-ats.iot.region.amazonaws.com
```

If you're using a legacy Verisign root CA certificate, we recommend that you create an ATS endpoint and use an ATS root CA certificate instead\. For more information, see [Server Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/managing-device-certs.html#server-authentication) in the *AWS IoT Developer Guide*\. Otherwise, make sure to use the corresponding legacy endpoints\. For example, the following syntax is used for legacy AWS IoT endpoints:

```
prefix.iot.region.amazonaws.com
```

If your endpoints and certificate type do not match, authentication attempts between AWS IoT and AWS IoT Greengrass fail\.

### Endpoints in `config.json`<a name="certificate-endpoints-config"></a>

On an AWS IoT Greengrass core device, in the [`config.json`](#config-json) file, the AWS IoT and AWS IoT Greengrass endpoints are specified in the `coreThing` object\. The `iotHost` property represents the AWS IoT endpoint\. The `ggHost` property represents the AWS IoT Greengrass endpoint\. In the following example snippet, these properties specify ATS endpoints\.

```
{
  "coreThing" : {
    ...
    "iotHost" : "abcde1234uwxyz-ats.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
    "ggHost" : "greengrass-ats.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com",
    ...
  },
```

**AWS IoT endpoint**  
You can get your AWS IoT endpoint by running the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/describe-endpoint.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot/describe-endpoint.html) CLI command with the appropriate `--endpoint-type` parameter\.  
+ To return an ATS signed endpoint, run:

  ```
  aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS
  ```
+ To return a legacy Verisign signed endpoint, run:

  ```
  aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data
  ```

**AWS IoT Greengrass endpoint**  
Your AWS IoT Greengrass endpoint is your `iotHost` endpoint with the host prefix replaced by *greengrass*\. For example, the ATS signed endpoint is `greengrass-ats.iot.region.amazonaws.com`\. This uses the same region as your AWS IoT endpoint\.

## Connect on Port 443 or Through a Network Proxy<a name="alpn-network-proxy"></a>

This feature is available for AWS IoT Greengrass Core v1\.7 and later\.

AWS IoT Greengrass communicates with AWS IoT using the MQTT messaging protocol with TLS client authentication\. By convention, MQTT over TLS uses port 8883\. However, as a security measure, restrictive environments might limit inbound and outbound traffic to a small range of TCP ports\. For example, a corporate firewall might open port 443 for HTTPS traffic, but close other ports that are used for less common protocols, such as port 8883 for MQTT traffic\. Other restrictive environments might require all traffic to go through an HTTP proxy before connecting to the internet\.

To enable communication in these scenarios, AWS IoT Greengrass allows the following configurations:
+ **MQTT with TLS client authentication over port 443**\. If your network allows connections to port 443, you can configure the core to use port 443 for MQTT traffic instead of the default port 8883\. This can be a direct connection to port 443 or a connection through a network proxy server\.

  AWS IoT Greengrass uses the [ Application Layer Protocol Network](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301) \(ALPN\) TLS extension to enable this connection\. As with the default configuration, MQTT over TLS on port 443 uses certificate\-based client authentication\.
+ **HTTPS communication over port 443**\. AWS IoT Greengrass sends HTTPS traffic over port 8443 by default, but you can configure it to use port 443\.
+ **Connection through a network proxy**\. You can configure a network proxy server to act as an intermediary for connecting to the AWS IoT Greengrass core\. Only basic authentication and HTTP and HTTPS proxies are supported\.

  The proxy configuration is passed to user\-defined Lambda functions through the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` environment variables\. If a function specifies these variables, AWS IoT Greengrass doesn't override them\.<a name="config-mqtt-port"></a>

**To configure MQTT over port 443**

This feature requires AWS IoT Greengrass v1\.7 or later\.

This procedure allows the core to use port 443 for MQTT messaging\.

           "caPath" : "root.ca.pem",
           "certPath" : "12345abcde.cert.pem",
           "keyPath" : "12345abcde.private.key",
           "thingArn" : "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/core-thing-name",

       ...
   }
   ```

1. Start the daemon\.

   ```
   cd /greengrass-root/ggc/core/
   sudo ./greengrassd start
   ```

Use the `networkProxy` object to specify information about the network proxy\. This object has the following properties\.


| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| noProxyAddresses |  Optional\. A comma\-separated list of IP addresses or host names that are exempt from the proxy\.  | 
| proxy |  The proxy to connect to\. A proxy has the following properties\. [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/gg-core.html)  | 

### Whitelisting Endpoints<a name="whitelist-endpoints-proxy"></a>

Communication between Greengrass devices and AWS IoT or AWS IoT Greengrass must be authenticated\. This authentication is based on registered X\.509 device certificates and cryptographic keys\. To allow authenticated requests to pass through proxies without additional encryption, whitelist the following endpoints\.


| Endpoint | Port | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| greengrass\.region\.amazonaws\.com | 443 |  Used for control plane operations for group management\.  | 
| `prefix-ats.iot.region.amazonaws.com` or `prefix.iot.region.amazonaws.com` | MQTT: 8883 or 443 HTTPS: 8443 or 443 |  Used for data plane operations for device management, such as shadow sync\. Whitelist one or both endpoints, depending on whether your core and connected devices use Amazon Trust Services \(preferred\) root CA certificates, legacy root CA certificates, or both\. For more information, see [Endpoints Must Match the Certificate Type](#certificate-endpoints)\.  | 
| `greengrass-ats.iot.region.amazonaws.com` or `greengrass.iot.region.amazonaws.com` | 8443 or 443 |  Used for device discovery operations\. Whitelist one or both endpoints, depending on whether your core and connected devices use Amazon Trust Services \(preferred\) root CA certificates, legacy root CA certificates, or both\. For more information, see [Endpoints Must Match the Certificate Type](#certificate-endpoints)\.  Clients that connect on port 443 must implement the [ Application Layer Protocol Negotiation \(ALPN\)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301) TLS extension and pass `x-amzn-http-ca` as the `ProtocolName` in the `ProtocolNameList`\. For more information, see [Protocols](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html) in the *AWS IoT Developer Guide*\.   | 
| \*\.s3\.amazonaws\.com | 443 |  Used for deployment operations and over\-the\-air updates\. This format includes the `*` character because endpoint prefixes are controlled internally and might change at any time\.  | 
| logs\.region\.amazonaws\.com | 443 |  Required if the Greengrass group is configured to write logs to CloudWatch\.  | 

## Configure a Write Directory for AWS IoT Greengrass<a name="write-directory"></a>

This feature is available for AWS IoT Greengrass Core v1\.6 and later\.

By default, the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software is deployed under a single root directory where AWS IoT Greengrass performs all read and write operations\. However, you can configure AWS IoT Greengrass to use a separate directory for all write operations, including creating directories and files\. In this case, AWS IoT Greengrass uses two top\-level directories:
+ The *greengrass\-root* directory, which you can leave as read\-write or optionally make read\-only\. This contains the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software and other critical components that should remain immutable during runtime, such as certificates and `config.json`\.
+ The specified write directory\. This contains writable content, such as logs, state information, and deployed user\-defined Lambda functions\.

This configuration results in the following directory structure\.

**Greengrass root directory**  

```
greengrass-root/
|-- certs/
|   |-- root.ca.pem
|   |-- hash.cert.pem
|   |-- hash.private.key
|   |-- hash.public.key
|-- config/
|   |-- config.json
|-- ggc/
|   |-- packages/
|       |-- package-version/
|           |-- bin/
|               |-- daemon 
|           |-- greengrassd
|           |-- lambda/
|           |-- LICENSE/
|           |-- release_notes_package-version.html
|               |-- runtime/
|                   |-- java8/
|                   |-- nodejs8.10/
|                   |-- python3.7/
|   |-- core/
```

**Write Directory**  

```
write-directory/
|-- packages/
|   |-- package-version/
|       |-- ggc_root/
|       |-- rootfs_nosys/
|       |-- rootfs_sys/
|       |-- var/
|-- deployment/
|   |-- group/
|       |-- group.json
|   |-- lambda/
|   |-- mlmodel/
|-- var/
|   |-- log/
|   |-- state/
```

Â 

**To configure a write directory**

1. Run the following command to stop the AWS IoT Greengrass daemon:

   ```
   cd /greengrass-root/ggc/core/
   sudo ./greengrassd stop
   ```

1. Open `greengrass-root/config/config.json` for editing as the su user\.

1. Add `writeDirectory` as a parameter and specify the path to the target directory, as shown in the following example\.

   ```
   {
       "coreThing": {
           "caPath": "root-CA.pem",
           "certPath": "hash.pem.crt",
           ...
       },
       ...
       "writeDirectory" : "/write-directory"
   }
   ```
**Note**  
You can update the `writeDirectory` setting as often as you want\. After the setting is updated, AWS IoT Greengrass uses the newly specified write directory at the next start, but doesn't migrate content from the previous write directory\.

1. Now that your write directory is configured, you can optionally make the *greengrass\-root* directory read\-only\. For instructions, see [To Make the Greengrass Root Directory Read\-Only](#configure-ro-directory)\.

   Otherwise, start the AWS IoT Greengrass daemon:

   ```
   cd /greengrass-root/ggc/core/
   sudo ./greengrassd start
   ```

Â <a name="configure-ro-directory"></a>

**To make the Greengrass root directory read\-only**

Follow these steps only if you want to make the Greengrass root directory read\-only\. The write directory must be configured before you begin\.

1. Grant access permissions to required directories:

   1. Give read and write permissions to the `config.json` owner\.

      ```
      sudo chmod 0600 /greengrass-root/config/config.json
      ```

   1. Make ggc\_user the owner of the certs and system Lambda directories\.

      ```
      sudo chown -R ggc_user:ggc_group /greengrass-root/certs/
      sudo chown -R ggc_user:ggc_group /greengrass-root/ggc/packages/1.9.1/lambda/
      ```
**Note**  
The ggc\_user and ggc\_group accounts are used by default to run system Lambda functions\. If you configured the group\-level [default access identity](lambda-group-config.md#lambda-access-identity-groupsettings) to use different accounts, you should give permissions to that user \(UID\) and group \(GID\) instead\.

1. Make the *greengrass\-root* directory read\-only by using your preferred mechanism\.
**Note**  
One way to make the *greengrass\-root* directory read\-only is to mount the directory as read\-only\. However, to apply over\-the\-air \(OTA\) updates to the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software in a mounted directory, the directory must first be unmounted, and then remounted after the update\. You can add these `umount` and `mount` operations to the `ota_pre_update` and `ota_post_update` scripts\. For more information about OTA updates, see [Greengrass OTA Agent](core-ota-update.md#ota-agent) and [AWS IoT Greengrass Core Update with Managed Respawn](core-ota-update.md#managed-respawn-ggc)\.

1. Start the daemon\.

   ```
   cd /greengrass-root/ggc/core/
   sudo ./greengrassd start
   ```

   If the permissions from step 1 aren't set correctly, then the daemon won't start\.

## Message Quality of Service<a name="message-quality-of-service"></a>

In the AWS IoT Greengrass environment, local devices, Lambda functions, connectors, and system components can communicate with each other and with the cloud\. All communication goes through the core\. Messages destined for local targets use a quality of service \(QoS\) level that is different from messages destined for the cloud\.
+  **Messages with local targets use QoS 0\.** The core makes one attempt to send a message to its target\. It doesn't store messages or confirm delivery\. Messages can be dropped anywhere between components\.
**Note**  
Although direct communication between Lambda functions doesn't use MQTT messaging, the behavior is the same\.
+ **Messages with cloud targets use QoS 1\.** The core sends these messages to the spooler system component, which sends them to the cloud using QoS 1\. This allows the spooler to manage the [MQTT message queue](#mqtt-message-queue.title)\. If message delivery isn't confirmed by AWS IoT, the message is spooled to be retried later \(unless the queue is full\)\. For more information, see [MQTT Message Queue](#mqtt-message-queue)\.
**Note**  
Although QoS 1 is used internally to manage the queue, message publishers can send MQTT messages with QoS 0 only\.

## MQTT Message Queue<a name="mqtt-message-queue"></a>

MQTT messages that are destined for cloud targets are queued to await processing\. Queued messages are processed in first in first out \(FIFO\) order\. After a message is processed and published to the cloud, the message is removed from the queue\. AWS IoT Greengrass manages the queue by using a system `GGCloudSpooler` Lambda function\.

### Configure the MQTT Message Queue<a name="configure-message-queue"></a>

This feature is available for AWS IoT Greengrass Core v1\.6 and later\.

You can configure AWS IoT Greengrass to store unprocessed messages in memory or in a local storage cache\. Unlike in\-memory storage, the local storage cache has the ability to persist across core restarts \(for example, after a group deployment or a device reboot\), so AWS IoT Greengrass can continue to process the messages\. You can also configure the storage size\.

**Note**  
Versions 1\.5\.0 and earlier use in\-memory storage with a queue size of 2\.5 MB\. You cannot configure storage settings for earlier versions\.

The following environment variables for the `GGCloudSpooler` Lambda function are used to define storage settings\.
+ **GG\_CONFIG\_STORAGE\_TYPE**\. The location of the message queue\. The following are valid values:
  + `FileSystem`\. Store unprocessed messages in the local storage cache\. When the core restarts, queued messages are retained for processing\. Messages are removed after they are processed\.
  + `Memory` \(default\)\. Store unprocessed messages in memory\. When the core restarts, queued messages are lost\.

    This option is optimized for devices with restricted hardware capabilities\. When using this configuration, we recommend that you deploy groups or restart the device when the service disruption is the lowest\.
+ **GG\_CONFIG\_MAX\_SIZE\_BYTES**\. The storage size, in bytes\. This value can be any non\-negative integer **greater than or equal to 262144** \(256 KB\); a smaller size prevents the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software from starting\. The default size is 2\.5 MB\. When the size limit is reached, the oldest queued messages are replaced by new messages\.

#### To Cache Messages in Local Storage<a name="configure-local-storage-cache"></a>

To configure AWS IoT Greengrass to cache messages to the file system so they persist across core restarts, you create a function definition version where the `GGCloudSpooler` function specifies the `FileSystem` storage type\. You must use the AWS IoT Greengrass API to configure the local storage cache\. You can't do this in the console\.

The following procedure uses the [ `create-function-definition-version`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/greengrass/create-function-definition-version.html) CLI command to configure the spooler to save queued messages to the file system\. It also configures a 2\.6 MB queue size\.

**Note**  
This procedure assumes that you're updating the configuration of the latest group version of an existing group\.

1. <a name="get-group-id-latestversion"></a>Get the IDs of the target Greengrass group and group version\.

   ```
   aws greengrass list-groups
   ```
**Note**  
 The list\-groups command only returns 50 groups at a time\. If you have more than 50 groups, specify the max\-results option with the desired number of results \(such as **100**\) to find your group:   

   ```
   aws greengrass list-groups --max-results 100
   ```

1. <a name="copy-group-id-latestversion"></a>Copy the `Id` and `LatestVersion` properties of your target group from the output\.

1. <a name="get-latest-group-version"></a>Get the latest group version\.
   + Replace *group\-id* with the `Id` that you copied\.
   + Replace *latest\-group\-version\-id* with the `LatestVersion` that you copied\.

   ```
   aws greengrass get-group-version \
   --group-id group-id \
   --group-version-id latest-group-version-id
   ```

1. <a name="copy-group-component-arns-except-function"></a>From the `Definition` object in the output, copy the `CoreDefinitionVersionArn` and the ARNs of all other group components except `FunctionDefinitionVersionArn`\. You use these values when you create a new group version\.

1. <a name="parse-function-def-id"></a>From the `FunctionDefinitionVersionArn` in the output, copy the ID of the function definition\. The ID is the GUID that follows the `functions` segment in the ARN\.
**Note**  
You can optionally create a function definition by running the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/greengrass/create-function-definition.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/greengrass/create-function-definition.html) command, and then copy the ID from the output\.

1. Add a function definition version to the function definition\.
   + Replace *function\-definition\-id* with the `Id` that you copied for the function definition\.
   + Replace *arbitrary\-function\-id* with a name for the function, such as **spooler\-function**\.
   + Add any Lambda functions that you want to include in this version to the `functions` array\. You can use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/greengrass/get-function-definition-version.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/greengrass/get-function-definition-version.html) command to get the Greengrass Lambda functions from an existing function definition version\.
**Warning**  
Make sure that you specify a value for `GG_CONFIG_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` that's **greater than or equal to 262144**\. A smaller size prevents the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software from starting\.

   ```
   aws greengrass create-function-definition-version \
   --function-definition-id function-definition-id \
   --functions '[{"FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:::function:GGCloudSpooler:1","FunctionConfiguration": {"Environment": {"Variables":{"GG_CONFIG_MAX_SIZE_BYTES":"2621440","GG_CONFIG_STORAGE_TYPE":"FileSystem"}},"Executable": "spooler","MemorySize": 32768,"Pinned": true,"Timeout": 3},"Id": "arbitrary-function-id"}]'
   ```

1. <a name="copy-function-def-version-arn"></a>Copy the `Arn` of the function definition version from the output\.

1. <a name="create-group-version-with-sys-lambda"></a>Create a group version that contains the system Lambda function\.
   + Replace *group\-id* with the `Id` for the group\.
   + Replace *core\-definition\-version\-arn* with the `CoreDefinitionVersionArn` that you copied from the latest group version\.
   + Replace *function\-definition\-version\-arn* with the `Arn` that you copied for the new function definition version\.
   + Replace the ARNs for other group components \(for example, `SubscriptionDefinitionVersionArn` or `DeviceDefinitionVersionArn`\) that you copied from the latest group version\.
   + Remove any unused parameters\. For example, remove the `--resource-definition-version-arn` if your group version doesn't contain any resources\.

   ```
   aws greengrass create-group-version \
   --group-id group-id \
   --core-definition-version-arn core-definition-version-arn \
   --function-definition-version-arn function-definition-version-arn \
   --device-definition-version-arn device-definition-version-arn \
   --logger-definition-version-arn logger-definition-version-arn \
   --resource-definition-version-arn resource-definition-version-arn \
   --subscription-definition-version-arn subscription-definition-version-arn
   ```

1. <a name="copy-group-version-id"></a>Copy the `Version` from the output\. This is the ID of the new group version\.

1. <a name="create-group-deployment"></a>Deploy the group\.
   + Replace *group\-id* with the `Id` that you copied for the group\.
   + Replace *group\-version\-id* with the `Version` that you copied for the new group version\.

   ```
   aws greengrass create-deployment \
   --group-id group-id \
   --group-version-id group-version-id \
   --deployment-type NewDeployment
   ```

 To update the storage settings, you use the AWS IoT Greengrass API to create a new function definition version that contains the `GGCloudSpooler` function with the updated configuration\. Then add the function definition version to a new group version \(along with your other group components\) and deploy the group version\. If you want to restore the default configuration, you can create a function definition version that doesn't include the `GGCloudSpooler` function\. 

 This system Lambda function isn't visible in the console\. However, after the function is added to the latest group version, it's included in deployments that you make from the console \(unless you use the API to replace or remove it\)\. 

## Client IDs for MQTT Connections with AWS IoT<a name="connection-client-id"></a>

This feature is available for AWS IoT Greengrass Core v1\.8 and later\.

The AWS IoT Greengrass core opens MQTT connections with AWS IoT for operations such as shadow sync and certificate management\. For these connections, the core generates predictable client IDs based on the core thing name\. Predictable client IDs can be used with monitoring, auditing, and pricing features, including AWS IoT Device Defender and [ AWS IoT lifecycle events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/life-cycle-events.html)\. You can also create logic around predictable client IDs \(for example, [subscribe policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/pub-sub-policy.html#pub-sub-policy-cert) templates based on certificate attributes\)\.

------
#### [ GGC v1\.9 ]

Two Greengrass system components open MQTT connections with AWS IoT\. These components use the following patterns to generate the client IDs for the connections\.


| Operation | Client ID pattern | 
| --- | --- | 
| Deployments | `core-thing-name` Example: `MyCoreThing` Use this client ID for connect, disconnect, subscribe, and unsubscribe lifecycle event notifications\. | 
| MQTT message exchange with AWS IoT | `core-thing-name-cnn` Example: `MyCoreThing-c01` `nn` is an integer that starts at 00 and increments with each new connection to a maximum of of 05\. The number of connections is determined by the number of devices that sync their shadow state with AWS IoT \(maximum 200 per group\) and the number of subscriptions with `cloud` as their source in the group \(maximum 50 per group\)\. The spooler system component makes connections with AWS IoT to exchange messages for subscriptions with a cloud source or target\. The spooler also acts as proxy for message exchange between AWS IoT and the local shadow service and device certificate manager\. | 

------
#### [ GGC v1\.8 ]

Several Greengrass system components open MQTT connections with AWS IoT\. These components use the following patterns to generate the client IDs for the connections\.


| Operation | Client ID pattern | 
| --- | --- | 
| Deployments | `core-thing-name` Example: `MyCoreThing` Use this client ID for connect, disconnect, subscribe, and unsubscribe lifecycle event notifications\. | 
| MQTT message exchange with AWS IoT | `core-thing-name-spr` Example: `MyCoreThing-spr` | 
| Shadow sync | `core-thing-name-snn` Example: `MyCoreThing-s01` `nn` is an integer that starts at 00 and increments with each new connection to a maximum of 03\. The number of connections is determined by the number of devices \(maximum 200 devices per group\) that sync their shadow state with AWS IoT \(maximum 50 subscriptions per connection\)\. | 
| Device certificate management | `core-thing-name-dcm` Example: `MyCoreThing-dcm` | 

------

**Note**  
Duplicate client IDs used in simultaneous connections can cause an infinite connect\-disconnect loop\. This can happen if another device is hard\-coded to use the core device name as the client ID in connections\. For more information, see this [troubleshooting step](gg-troubleshooting.md#config-client-id)\.

Greengrass devices are also fully integrated with the Fleet Indexing service of AWS IoT Device Management\. This allows you to index and search for devices based on device attributes, shadow state, and connection state in the cloud\. For example, Greengrass devices establish at least one connection that uses the thing name as the client ID, so you can use device connectivity indexing to discover which Greengrass devices are currently connected or disconnected to AWS IoT\. For more information, see [Fleet Indexing Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-indexing.html) in the *AWS IoT Developer Guide*\.

## Activate Automatic IP Detection<a name="ip-auto-detect"></a>

 You can configure AWS IoT Greengrass to enable automatic discovery of your AWS IoT Greengrass core using the `IPDetector` system Lambda function\. This feature can also be enabled by choosing **Automatic detection** when deploying your group from the console for the first time, or from the group settings page in the console at any time\. 

 The following procedure uses the [ `create-function-definition-version`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/greengrass/create-function-definition-version.html) CLI command to configure automatic discovery of the Greengrass core\. 

**Note**  
 This procedure assumes that you're updating the configuration of the latest group version of an existing group\. 

1. <a name="get-group-id-latestversion"></a>Get the IDs of the target Greengrass group and group version\.

   ```
   aws greengrass list-groups
   ```
**Note**  
 The list\-groups command only returns 50 groups at a time\. If you have more than 50 groups, specify the max\-results option with the desired number of results \(such as **100**\) to find your group:   

   ```
   aws greengrass list-groups --max-results 100
   ```

1. <a name="copy-group-id-latestversion"></a>Copy the `Id` and `LatestVersion` properties of your target group from the output\.

1. <a name="get-latest-group-version"></a>Get the latest group version\.
   + Replace *group\-id* with the `Id` that you copied\.
   + Replace *latest\-group\-version\-id* with the `LatestVersion` that you copied\.

   ```
   aws greengrass get-group-version \
   --group-id group-id \
   --group-version-id latest-group-version-id
   ```

1. <a name="copy-group-component-arns-except-function"></a>From the `Definition` object in the output, copy the `CoreDefinitionVersionArn` and the ARNs of all other group components except `FunctionDefinitionVersionArn`\. You use these values when you create a new group version\.

1. From the `FunctionDefinitionVersionArn` in the output, copy the ID of the function definition and the function definition version:

   ```
   arn:aws:greengrass:region:account-id:/greengrass/groups/function-definition-id/versions/function-definition-version-id
   ```
**Note**  
You can optionally create a function definition by running the [ `create-function-definition`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/greengrass/create-function-definition.html) command, and then copy the ID from the output\.

1.  Use the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/greengrass/get-function-definition-version.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/greengrass/get-function-definition-version.html) command to get the current definition state\. Use the *function\-definition\-id* you copied for the function definiton\. For example, *4d941bc7\-92a1\-4f45\-8d64\-EXAMPLEf76c3*\. 

   ```
   aws greengrass get-function-definition-version
   --function-definition-id function-definition-id
   --function-definition-version-id function-definition-version-id
   ```

    Make a note of the listed function configurations\. You will need to include these when creating a new function definition version in order to prevent loss of your current definition settings\. 

1.  Add a function definition version to the function definition\. 
   + Replace *function\-definition\-id* with the `Id` that you copied for the function definition\. For example, *4d941bc7\-92a1\-4f45\-8d64\-EXAMPLEf76c3*\.
   + Replace *arbitrary\-function\-id* with a name for the function, such as **auto\-detection\-function**\.
   + Add all Lambda functions that you want to include in this version to the `functions` array, such as any listed in the previous step\.

   ```
   aws greengrass create-function-definition-version \
   --function-definition-id function-definition-id \
   --functions '[{"FunctionArn":"arn:aws:lambda:::function:GGIPDetector:1","Id":"arbitrary-function-id","FunctionConfiguration":{"Pinned":true,"MemorySize":32768,"Timeout":3}}]'\
   --region us-west-2
   ```

1. <a name="copy-function-def-version-arn"></a>Copy the `Arn` of the function definition version from the output\.

1. <a name="create-group-version-with-sys-lambda"></a>Create a group version that contains the system Lambda function\.
   + Replace *group\-id* with the `Id` for the group\.
   + Replace *core\-definition\-version\-arn* with the `CoreDefinitionVersionArn` that you copied from the latest group version\.
   + Replace *function\-definition\-version\-arn* with the `Arn` that you copied for the new function definition version\.
   + Replace the ARNs for other group components \(for example, `SubscriptionDefinitionVersionArn` or `DeviceDefinitionVersionArn`\) that you copied from the latest group version\.
   + Remove any unused parameters\. For example, remove the `--resource-definition-version-arn` if your group version doesn't contain any resources\.

   ```
   aws greengrass create-group-version \
   --group-id group-id \
   --core-definition-version-arn core-definition-version-arn \
   --function-definition-version-arn function-definition-version-arn \
   --device-definition-version-arn device-definition-version-arn \
   --logger-definition-version-arn logger-definition-version-arn \
   --resource-definition-version-arn resource-definition-version-arn \
   --subscription-definition-version-arn subscription-definition-version-arn
   ```

1. <a name="copy-group-version-id"></a>Copy the `Version` from the output\. This is the ID of the new group version\.

1. <a name="create-group-deployment"></a>Deploy the group\.
   + Replace *group\-id* with the `Id` that you copied for the group\.
   + Replace *group\-version\-id* with the `Version` that you copied for the new group version\.

   ```

 If you want to manually input the IP address of your AWS IoT Greengrass core, you can complete this tutorial with a different function definition that does not include the `IPDetector` function\. This will prevent the detection function from locating and automatically inputting your AWS IoT Greengrass core IP address\.  

 This system Lambda function isn't visible in the Lambda console\. After the function is added to the latest group version, it's included in deployments that you make from the console \(unless you use the API to replace or remove it\)\. 

## Configure the Init System to Start the Greengrass Daemon<a name="start-on-boot"></a>

It's a good practice to set up your init system to start the Greengrass daemon during boot, especially when managing large fleets of devices\.

There are different types of init system, such as initd, systemd, and SystemV, and they use similar configuration parameters\. The following example is a service file for systemd\. The `Type` parameter is set to `forking` because greengrassd \(which is used to start Greengrass\) forks the Greengrass daemon process, and the `Restart` parameter is set to `on-failure` to direct systemd to restart Greengrass if Greengrass enters a failed state\.

**Note**  
To see if your device uses systemd, run the `check_ggc_dependencies` script as described in [Module 1](module1.md)\. Then to use systemd, make sure that the `useSystemd` parameter in [`config.json`](#config-json) is set to `yes`\.

```
[Unit]
Description=Greengrass Daemon

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/var/run/greengrassd.pid
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/greengrass/ggc/core/greengrassd start
ExecReload=/greengrass/ggc/core/greengrassd restart
ExecStop=/greengrass/ggc/core/greengrassd stop

[Install]

```

For information about how to create and enable a service file for systemd on a Raspberry Pi, see [SYSTEMD](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/systemd.md) in the Raspberry Pi documentation\.

## Archive an AWS IoT Greengrass Core Software Installation<a name="archive-ggc-version"></a>

When you upgrade to a new version of the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, you can archive the currently installed version\. This preserves your current installation environment so you can test a new software version on the same hardware\. This also makes it easy to roll back to your archived version for any reason\.

**To archive the current installation and install a new version**

1. Download the [AWS IoT Greengrass Core Software](what-is-gg.md#gg-core-download-tab) installation package that you want to upgrade to\.

1. Copy the package to the destination core device\. For instructions that show how to transfer files, see this [step](gg-device-start.md#transfer-files-to-device)\.
**Note**  
You copy your current certificates, keys, and configuration file to the new installation later\.

   Run the commands in the following steps in your core device terminal\.

1. Make sure that the Greengrass daemon is stopped on the core device\.

   1. To check whether the daemon is running:

      ```
      ps aux | grep -E 'greengrass.*daemon'
      ```

      If the output contains a `root` entry for `/greengrass/ggc/packages/ggc-version/bin/daemon`, then the daemon is running\.
**Note**  
This procedure is written with the assumption that the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software is installed in the `/greengrass` directory\.

   1. To stop the daemon:

      ```
      cd /greengrass/ggc/core/
      sudo ./greengrassd stop
      ```

1. Move the current Greengrass root directory to a different directory\.

   ```
   sudo mv /greengrass /greengrass_backup
   ```

1. Untar the new software on the core device\. Replace the *os\-architecture* and *version* placeholders in the command\.

   ```
   sudo tar âzxvf greengrass-os-architecture-version.tar.gz âC /
   ```

1. Copy the archived certificates, keys, and configuration file to the new installation\.

   ```
   sudo cp /greengrass_backup/certs/* /greengrass/certs
   sudo cp /greengrass_backup/config/* /greengrass/config
   ```

1. Start the daemon:

   ```
   cd /greengrass/ggc/core/
   sudo ./greengrassd start
   ```

Now, you can make a group deployment to test the new installation\. If something fails, you can restore the archived installation\.

**To restore the archived installation**

1. Stop the daemon\.

1. Delete the new `/greengrass` directory\.

1. Move the `/greengrass_backup` directory back to `/greengrass`\.

1. Start the daemon\.
