AWS IoT Greengrass Version 1 no longer receives feature updates, and will receive only security patches and bug fixes until June 30, 2023\. For more information, see the [AWS IoT Greengrass V1 maintenance policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v1/developerguide/maintenance-policy.html)\. We strongly recommend that you [migrate to AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/move-from-v1.html), which adds [significant new features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-v2-whats-new.html) and [support for additional platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/operating-system-feature-support-matrix.html)\.

# Infrastructure security in AWS IoT Greengrass<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, AWS IoT Greengrass is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper\.

You use AWS published API calls to access AWS IoT Greengrass through the network\. Clients must support Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) 1\.0 or later\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\), such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\.

Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

In an AWS IoT Greengrass environment, devices use X\.509 certificates and cryptographic keys to connect and authenticate to the AWS Cloud\. For more information, see [Device authentication and authorization for AWS IoT Greengrass](device-auth.md)\.
