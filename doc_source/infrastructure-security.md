You are viewing the documentation for AWS IoT Greengrass Version 1, which has moved into [maintenance mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v1/developerguide/maintenance-policy.html)\. If you're new to AWS IoT Greengrass, we strongly recommend that you use AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2, which receives new features, includes all key V1 features, and supports additional platforms and continuous deployments to large fleets of devices\. For more information, see [What's new in AWS IoT Greengrass V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-v2-whats-new.html) and [Move from AWS IoT Greengrass V1 to V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/move-from-v1.html)\.

# Infrastructure security in AWS IoT Greengrass<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, AWS IoT Greengrass is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in the [Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) whitepaper\.

You use AWS published API calls to access AWS IoT Greengrass through the network\. Clients must support Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) 1\.0 or later\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\), such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\.

Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

In an AWS IoT Greengrass environment, devices use X\.509 certificates and cryptographic keys to connect and authenticate to the AWS Cloud\. For more information, see [Device authentication and authorization for AWS IoT Greengrass](device-auth.md)\.
