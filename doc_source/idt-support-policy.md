We recommend that you use the most recent version of AWS IoT Greengrass and IDT to test or qualify your devices\. For more information, see [Supported versions of IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/dev-test-versions.html) in the *AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 Developer Guide*\.

You can also use any of the supported versions of AWS IoT Greengrass and IDT to test or qualify your devices\. Although you can continue to use [unsupported versions of IDT](dev-test-versions.md#idt-unsupported-versions), those versions do not receive bug fixes or updates\.
