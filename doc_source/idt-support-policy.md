# Support policy for AWS IoT Device Tester for AWS IoT Greengrass V1<a name="idt-support-policy"></a>

AWS IoT Device Tester \(IDT\) for AWS IoT Greengrass is a test automation tool used to validate and [qualify](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/dqp/) your AWS IoT Greengrass devices for inclusion in the [AWS Partner Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com/)\. We recommend that you use the most recent version of AWS IoT Greengrass and IDT to test or qualify your devices\. For more information, see [Supported versions of IDT for AWS IoT Greengrass V2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/dev-test-versions.html) in the *AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 Developer Guide*\.

You can also use any of the supported versions of AWS IoT Greengrass and IDT to test or qualify your devices\. Although you can continue to use [unsupported versions of IDT](dev-test-versions.md#idt-unsupported-versions), those versions do not receive bug fixes or updates\.

**Important**  
Starting April 4, 2022, AWS IoT Device Tester \(IDT\) for AWS IoT Greengrass V1 will no longer generate signed qualification reports\. After this date, you will no longer be able to qualify new AWS IoT Greengrass V1 devices to list in the [AWS Partner Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com/) through the [AWS Device Qualification Program](http://aws.amazon.com/partners/programs/dqp/)\.
