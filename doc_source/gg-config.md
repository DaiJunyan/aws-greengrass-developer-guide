![\[Welcome to AWS Greengrass console page with the Get Started button highlighted.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-004.png)

1. Create an AWS Greengrass group\. An AWS Greengrass group contains information about the devices and how messages are processed in the group\. Each AWS Greengrass group requires an AWS Greengrass core device that processes messages sent within the group\. An AWS Greengrass core needs a certificate and an AWS IoT policy to access AWS Greengrass and AWS Cloud Services\. On the **Set up your Greengrass group** page, choose **Use easy creation**\.

   1. Under **Download and store your Core's security resources**, choose **Download these resources as a tar\.gz** to download the required security resources for your AWS Greengrass core\.

   1. Under **Software configurations** for the AWS Greengrass core software, choose the CPU architecture and distribution \(and operating system, if necessary\) that best describes your core device:
      + If you're using a Raspberry Pi, download the ARMv7l for Raspbian Jessie package\.
      + If you're using an Amazon EC2 instance, download one of the x86\_64 packages\.
