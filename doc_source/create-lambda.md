# Create and Package a Lambda Function<a name="create-lambda"></a>

For a Python Lambda function to run on an AWS IoT Greengrass core, it must be packaged with the `greengrasssdk` folder from the Python AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK\. In the this section, you:
+ Download the Python AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK to your computer \(not the AWS IoT Greengrass core device\)\. You can download the SDK  from the [AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK](what-is-gg.md#gg-core-sdk-download) downloads\. 
+ Decompress the downloaded SDK file\.
+ Obtain the Python Lambda function \(named `greengrassHelloWorld.py`\) from the decompressed SDK\.
+ Create a Lambda function deployment package named `hello_world_python_lambda.zip` that contains `greengrassHelloWorld.py` and the `greengrasssdk` folder\.
+ Use the Lambda console to upload the `hello_world_python_lambda.zip` package\. 
+ Use the AWS IoT Core console to transfer the package to the AWS IoT Greengrass core device \(during group deployment\)\.

1.  Download the SDK from the [AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK](what-is-gg.md#gg-core-sdk-download) downloads page\. Locate the **Python 2\.7** section, and choose ** v1\.3\.0 \- current version** to download the SDK\. 

1. Decompress the downloaded `greengrass-core-python-sdk-1.3.0.tar.gz` file so you can get the Lambda function code and the SDK\. For instructions, choose the tab that corresponds to your operating system\.

------
#### [ Windows ]

   Use a tool for decompressing `.tar.gz` files on Windows such as [7\-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/), [WinZip](http://www.winzip.com/), or similar\. For example, the following steps use 7\-Zip\.

   1. After you install 7\-Zip, use Windows File Explorer \(Windows logo key \+ E\) to navigate to `greengrass-core-python-sdk-1.3.0.tar.gz`, right\-click the file, choose **7\-Zip**, and then choose **Extract Here**\. This creates the `greengrass-core-python-sdk-1.3.0.tar` file\.

   1. Right\-click the `greengrass-core-python-sdk-1.3.0.tar` file, choose **7\-Zip**, and then choose **Extract Here**\. This creates the `aws_greengrass_core_sdk` folder\.

   1. Expand the `aws_greengrass_core_sdk` and `sdk` folders, and then unzip `python_sdk_1_3_0.zip`\.

------
#### [ macOS ]

   1. Using Finder, navigate to the `greengrass-core-python-sdk-1.3.0.tar.gz` file and double\-click it\. This creates the `aws_greengrass_core_sdk` folder\.

   1. Expand the `aws_greengrass_core_sdk` and `sdk` folders, and then unzip `python_sdk_1_3_0.zip`\.

------
#### [ UNIX\-like system ]

   1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory that contains the `greengrass-core-python-sdk-1.3.0.tar.gz` file\.

   1. Run the following command to decompress the file:

      ```
      tar -xzf greengrass-core-python-sdk-1.3.0.tar.gz
      ```

      This creates the `aws_greengrass_core_sdk` directory\.

   1. Unzip the `python_sdk_1_3_0.zip` file\.

      ```
      cd aws_greengrass_core_sdk/sdk
      sudo unzip python_sdk_1_3_0.zip
      ```

------

   The Lambda function in this module uses:
   + The `greengrassHelloWorld.py` file in `examples\HelloWorld`\. This is your Lambda function code\.
   + The `greengrasssdk` folder in `sdk\python_sdk_1_3_0`\. This is the SDK\.

   The following code is from `greengrassHelloWorld.py`\. \(To save space, all code comments have been removed\.\) Note that every five seconds, the function publishes one of two possible messages to the `hello/world` topic\.

   ```
   import greengrasssdk
   import platform
   from threading import Timer
   import time
   
   client = greengrasssdk.client('iot-data')
   my_platform = platform.platform()
   
   def greengrass_hello_world_run():
       if not my_platform:
           client.publish(topic='hello/world', payload='Hello world! Sent from Greengrass Core.')
       else:
           client.publish(topic='hello/world', payload='Hello world! Sent from Greengrass Core running on platform: {}'.format(my_platform))
       Timer(5, greengrass_hello_world_run).start()
   
   greengrass_hello_world_run()
   
   def function_handler(event, context):
       return
   ```

1. Copy `greengrasssdk` to the `HelloWorld` folder that contains `greengrassHelloWorld.py`\.

1. To create the Lambda function deployment package, save the `greengrassHelloWorld.py` file and the `greengrasssdk` folder to a compressed \.zip file named `hello_world_python_lambda.zip`\. The \.py file and SDK folder must be in the root of the directory\.  
![\[Screenshot showing zipped contents of hello_word_python_lambda.zip.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-017.png)

   For UNIX\-like systems \(including the Mac terminal\), you can use the following command to package the file and folder:

   ```
   sudo zip -r hello_world_python_lambda.zip greengrasssdk greengrassHelloWorld.py
   ```
**Note**  
Depending on your distribution, you might need to install `zip` first \(for example, by running `sudo apt-get install zip`\)\. The installation command for your distribution might be different\.

   Now you're ready to create your Lambda function and upload the deployment package\.

1. Open the Lambda console and choose **Create function**\.

1. Choose **Author from scratch**\.

1. Name your function **Greengrass\_HelloWorld**, and set the remaining fields as follows:
   + For **Runtime**, choose **Python 2\.7**\.
   + For **Role**, choose **Create new role from one or more templates**\.
   + For **Role name**, enter a unique name for the role\. \(This role isn't used by AWS IoT Greengrass\.\)

   Choose **Create function**\.  
![\[The "Author from scratch" section with the "Name" field set to "Greengrass_HelloWorld", the "Runtime" field set to "Python 2.7", the "Role" field set to "Create new role from one or more templates".\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-023.png)

1. Upload your Lambda function deployment package:

   1. On the **Configuration** tab, under **Function code**, set the following fields:
      + For **Code entry type**, choose **Upload a \.zip file**\.
      + For **Runtime**, choose **Python 2\.7**\.
      + For **Handler**, enter **greengrassHelloWorld\.function\_handler**

   1. Choose **Upload**, and then choose `hello_world_python_lambda.zip`\. \(The size of your `hello_world_python_lambda.zip` file might be different from what's shown here\.\)  
![\[Screenshot of the Configuration tab with Upload a .zip file, Python 2.7, greengrassHelloWorld.function_handler, and Upload highlighted.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-024.png)

   1. Choose **Save**\.  
![\[Screenshot with the Save button highlighted.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-025.png)
**Note**  
The **Test** button on the AWS Lambda console doesn't work with this function\. The AWS IoT Greengrass Core SDK doesn't contain modules that are required to run your Greengrass Lambda functions independently in the AWS Lambda console\. These modules \(for example, `greengrass_common`\) are supplied to the functions after they are deployed to your Greengrass core\.
**Tip**  
To see your uploaded code, from **Code entry type**, choose **Edit code inline**\.

1. <a name="publish-function-version"></a>Publish the Lambda function:

   1. From **Actions**, choose **Publish new version**\.  
![\[Screenshot of the Actions menu with Publish new version highlighted.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-026.png)

   1. For **Version description**, enter **First version**, and then choose **Publish**\.  
![\[Screenshot with the Version description field set to First version and the Publish button highlighted.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-027.png)

1. <a name="create-version-alias"></a>Create an [alias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/versioning-aliases.html) for the Lambda function version:
**Note**  
Greengrass groups can reference a Lambda function by alias \(recommended\) or by version\. Using an alias makes it easier to manage code updates because you don't have to change your subscription table or group definition when the function code is updated\. Instead, you just point the alias to the new function version\.

   1. From **Actions**, choose **Create alias**\.  
![\[Screenshot of the Actions menu set to Create alias.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-028.png)

   1. Name the alias **GG\_HelloWorld**, set the version to **1** \(which corresponds to the version that you just published\), and then choose **Create**\.
**Note**  
AWS IoT Greengrass doesn't support Lambda aliases for **$LATEST** versions\.
