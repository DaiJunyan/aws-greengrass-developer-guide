# Test Communications<a name="test-comms"></a>

1. Make sure that your computer and the AWS Greengrass core device are connected to the internet and are using the same network\. The following procedure can be used to confirm this:

   1. Determine the IP address of the AWS Greengrass core by running the following command:

      ```
      hostname -I
      ```

   1. From your computer, run the following command using the core's IP address \(you can use Ctrl \+ C to halt the `ping` command\):

      ```
      ping IP-address
      ```

      Output similar to the following indicates successful communication between the computer and the AWS Greengrass core device \(note 0% packet loss\):

1. From the AWS IoT console, choose **Settings**, and note the value of **Endpoint**:  
![\[AWS IoT endpoint value.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-075.7.png)

    In the below, the endpoint value is indicated by *AWS\_IOT\_ENDPOINT*\. 

1. Choose **Greengrass**, **Groups**, and then choose your group\. Choose **Settings**, select **Manually manage connection information**, then choose **View Cores for specific endpoint information**\. Choose your core, then **Connectivity**\. Choose **Edit** and ensure your have only one **Endpoint** value which must be the IP address of your AWS Greengrass core device \(for port 8883\)\. Choose **Update**\. This ensures that the `basicDiscovery.py` script will connect to the correct AWS Greengrass core device IP address\.

1. Open two [command\-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) windows on your computer \(not the AWS Greengrass core device\)\. One command\-line window will be for the **HelloWorld\_Publisher** device and the other for the **HelloWorld\_Subscriber** device\. Every time the following script \(`basicDiscovery.py`\) is executed for the first time, the AWS Greengrass discovery service connects to the AWS Greengrass core\. After a device has discovered the AWS Greengrass core and successfully connected to it, future messaging and operations can be executed locally \(without the need for an internet connection\)\.
**Note**  
You can run the following command from the folder containing the `basicDiscovery.py` file for detailed script usage information:  

   ```
   python basicDiscovery.py --help
   ```

   From the **HelloWorld\_Publisher** device window, run the following commands:

   ```
   cd path-to-certs-folder
   python basicDiscovery.py --endpoint AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT --rootCA root-ca-cert.pem --cert publisher.cert.pem --key publisher.private.key --thingName HelloWorld_Publisher --topic 'hello/world/pubsub' --mode publish --message 'Hello, World! Sent from HelloWorld_Publisher'
   ```

   You should see output similar to the following:  
![\[Screenshot of the publisher output.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-076.png)
**Note**  
If you get a message about unrecognized arguments, try changing the single quotes to double quotes for the `message` parameter\.

1. From the **HelloWorld\_Subscriber** device window, run the following commands:

   ```
   cd path-to-certs-folder
   python basicDiscovery.py --endpoint AWS_IOT_ENDPOINT --rootCA root-ca-cert.pem --cert subscriber.cert.pem --key subscriber.private.key --thingName HelloWorld_Subscriber --topic 'hello/world/pubsub' --mode subscribe
   ```

   You should see the following output:  
![\[Screenshot of the subscriber output.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/images/gg-get-started-077.png)

Notice that closing the **HelloWorld\_Publisher** window halts additional messages from accruing in the **HelloWorld\_Subscriber** window\.
