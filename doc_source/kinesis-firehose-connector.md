# Kinesis Firehose<a name="kinesis-firehose-connector"></a>

The Kinesis Firehose [connector](connectors.md) publishes data through an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to destinations such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon Elasticsearch Service\.

This connector is a data producer for a Kinesis delivery stream\. It receives input data on an MQTT topic, and sends the data to a specified delivery stream\. The delivery stream then sends the data record to the configured destination \(for example, an S3 bucket\)\.

**ARN**: `arn:aws:greengrass:region::/connectors/KinesisFirehose/versions/1`

## Requirements<a name="kinesis-firehose-connector-req"></a>

This connector has the following requirements:
+ AWS IoT Greengrass Core Software v1\.7\.0\.
+ [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 2\.7 installed on the core device and added to the PATH environment variable\.
+ A configured Kinesis delivery stream\. For more information, see [Creating an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html) in the *Amazon Kinesis Firehose Developer Guide*\.
+ An IAM policy added to the Greengrass group role that allows the `firehose:PutRecord` action on the target delivery stream, as shown in the following example:

  ```
  {
      "Version":"2012-10-17",
      "Statement":[
          {
              "Sid":"Stmt1528133056761",
              "Action":[
                  "firehose:PutRecord"
              ],
              "Effect":"Allow",
              "Resource":[
                  "arn:aws:firehose:region:account-id:deliverystream/stream-name"
              ]
          }
      ]
   }
  ```

  This connector allows you to dynamically override the default delivery stream in the input message payload\. If your implementation uses this feature, the IAM policy must allow the `firehose:PutRecord` permission for all target streams\. You can grant granular or conditional access to resources \(for example, by using a wildcard \* naming scheme\)\. For more information, see [ Adding and Removing IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Connector Parameters<a name="kinesis-firehose-connector-param"></a>

This connector provides the following parameters:

`DefaultDeliveryStreamArn`  
The ARN of the default Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to send data to\. The destination stream can be overridden by the `delivery_stream_arn` property in the input message payload\.  
The group role must allow `firehose:PutRecord` permission on all target delivery streams\. For more information, see [Requirements](#kinesis-firehose-connector-req)\.
Display name in console: **Default delivery stream ARN**  
Required: `true`  
Type: `string`  
Valid pattern: `arn:aws:firehose:([a-z]{2}-[a-z]+-\d{1}):(\d{12}):deliverystream/([a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]+)$`

### Create Connector Example \(CLI\)<a name="kinesis-firehose-connector-create"></a>

The following CLI command creates an `ConnectorDefinition` with an initial version that contains the Kinesis Firehose connector\.

```
aws greengrass create-connector-definition --name MyGreengrassConnectors --initial-version '{
    "Connectors": [
        {
            "Id": "MyKinesisFirehoseConnector",
            "ConnectorArn": "arn:aws:greengrass:region::/connectors/KinesisFirehose/versions/1",
            "Parameters": {
                "DefaultDeliveryStreamArn": "arn:aws:firehose:region:account-id:deliverystream/stream-name"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

In the AWS IoT Greengrass console, you can add a connector from the group's **Connectors** page\. For more information, see [Getting Started with Greengrass Connectors \(Console\)](connectors-console.md)\.

## Input Data<a name="kinesis-firehose-connector-data-input"></a>

This connector accepts stream content on MQTT topics, and then sends the content to the target delivery stream\. It accepts two types of input data:
+ JSON data on the `kinesisfirehose/message` topic\.
+ Binary data on the `kinesisfirehose/message/binary/#` topic\.

**Topic filter**: `kinesisfirehose/message`  
Use this topic to send a message that contains JSON data\.    
**Message properties**    
`request`  
The data to send to the delivery stream and the target delivery stream, if different from the default stream\.  
Required: `true`  
Type: `object` that includes the following properties:    
`data`  
The data to send to the delivery stream\.  
Required: `true`  
Type: `bytes`  
`delivery_stream_arn`  
The ARN of the target Kinesis delivery stream\. Include this property to override the default delivery stream\.  
Required: `false`  
Type: `string`  
Valid pattern: `arn:aws:firehose:([a-z]{2}-[a-z]+-\d{1}):(\d{12}):deliverystream/([a-zA-Z0-9_\-.]+)$`  
`id`  
An arbitrary ID for the request\. This property is used to map an input request to an output response\. When specified, the `id` property in the response object is set to this value\. If you don't use this feature, you can omit this property or specify an empty string\.  
Required: `false`  
Type: `string`  
Valid pattern: `.*`  
**Example input**  

```
{
     "request": {
        "delivery_stream_arn": "arn:aws:firehose:region:account-id:deliverystream/stream2-name",
        "data": "Data to send to the delivery stream."
     },
     "id": "request123"
}
```
Â 

**Topic filter**: `kinesisfirehose/message/binary/#`  
Use this topic to send a message that contains binary data\. The connector doesn't parse binary data\. The data is streamed as is\.  
To map the input request to an output response, replace the `#` wildcard in the message topic with an arbitrary request ID\. For example, if you publish a message to `kinesisfirehose/message/binary/request123`, the `id` property in the response object is set to `request123`\.  
If you don't want to map a request to a response, you can publish your messages to `kinesisfirehose/message/binary/`\. Be sure to include the trailing slash\.

## Output Data<a name="kinesis-firehose-connector-data-output"></a>

This connector publishes status information as output data\.

**Topic filter**  
`kinesisfirehose/message/status`

**Example output: Success**  

```
{
   "response": {
        "firehose_record_id": "1lxfuuuFomkpJYzt/34ZU/r8JYPf8Wyf7AXqlXm",
        "status": "success"
    },
    "id": "request123"
}
```

**Example output: Failure**  

```
{
   "response" : {
        "error": "ResourceNotFoundException",
        "error_message": "An error occurred (ResourceNotFoundException) when calling the PutRecord operation: Firehose test1 not found under account 123456789012.",
        "status": "fail"
   },
   "id": "request123"
}
```
