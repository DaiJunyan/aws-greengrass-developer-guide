# Verify the Lambda Function Is Running on the Device<a name="lambda-check"></a>

From the left pane of the AWS IoT console, choose **Test**\.

In **Subscription topic** field, type **hello/world** \(don't choose **Subscribe to topic** yet\)\. For **Quality of Service**, select **0**\. For **MQTT payload display**, select **Display payloads as strings \(more accurate\)**\.

Next, choose **Subscribe to topic**\.

Assuming the Lambda function is running on your device, it will publish messages to the **hello/world** topic similar to the following:

**Note**  
Although the Lambda function running on the AWS Greengrass core device continues to send MQTT messages to the **hello/world** topic in the AWS IoT cloud, don't stop the AWS Greengrass daemon because the remaining modules assume that it's running\.
