# Module 4: Interacting with Devices in an AWS IoT Greengrass Group<a name="module4"></a>

This module shows you how AWS IoT devices can connect to and communicate with an AWS IoT Greengrass core device\. AWS IoT devices that connect to an AWS IoT Greengrass core are part of an AWS IoT Greengrass group and can participate in the AWS IoT Greengrass programming paradigm\. In this module, one Greengrass device sends a Hello World message to another device in the Greengrass group\.
